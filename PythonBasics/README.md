# Basics of Python
These assignments aim to introduce students to Python. Follow the instructions below to get started.
## Installing Requirements
We recommend having a Linux or macOS development environment for convenience. We recommend using Anaconda to manage your packages. <br><br>
Install Python 3 (version >= 3.7.3 recommended), along with pip. <br><br>
For the other requirements, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Modules
Complete each module and get your code verified before moving onto the next. Useful lookups are provided in the Lookups folder. Use StackOverflow to clear any programming doubts. If you're stuck, don't hesitate to ask a TA for help.
## Doing the Assignments
Download or clone this repository and fill the cells with your code, clearly following the instructions given in the Notebooks. **If you do not adhere to the instructions, your code will not pass the automated verification. Also, do not change filenames or function names.**
## Verification
To get your assignments verified, follow these instructions:
* Create a **private repository** on GitHub. <br>
* Add **solarillion** as a **Collaborator** in the repository settings. <br>
* Go to the **Webhooks** section in the repository settings, and click **Add webhook**. <br>
* Fill in the **Payload URL** and **Secret** from the **message TARS sent you** earlier. <br>
* Also change the **Content Type** to **application/json** and finally click the Add webhook button. <br>
* Upload the files containing your code for verification <br>

You must follow these instructions exactly, or your assignments will not be verified. You may now do your assignments, and if you are familiar with Git, use the Command Line Interface. If you are not using Git on your Terminal and are using GitHub's GUI, please follow this process:
* Delete the module you want to update, in your GitHub repository. <br>
* Upload the updated module file to GitHub with the same file name. <br>
* For example, if you're updating your Module 1 code, delete Module1.ipynb on GitHub (not your local folder) and upload your latest version of Module1.ipynb to GitHub. <br>

The assignments will be automatically verified by Hyouka, our code evaluator. It will notify you of any errors or unexpected problems in your code via our bot, TARS. In case further verification by a TA is required, you will be informed by TARS. Contact a TA if you have any queries. <br><br>
Good luck, and have fun!
